  Introduction:
    In this project, we have developed a dynamic and scalable website leveraging the power of PostgreSQL for robust data management. Our website is designed to help you understand how a website works, the connection between frontend and backend and the database. Tools and Framemork used to built this website are:
        1. express.js(node.js)
        2. postgreSQL
        3. embedded javascript
        4. cascading style sheet
  Installation:
    To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    Install dependencies: npm install express pg body-parser nodemon
    Configure PostgreSQL: Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in config.js or settings.py, etc.
    Run the application: npm start or nodemon index.js.
  Usage:
    Once the project is set up, you can start using it by following these steps:

        Accessing the Website: Open your web browser and navigate to localhost:3001.
        User Interactions: 1. if you have already signed up, enter the name and password and get inside. Else, signup using your username and 
                           password and press enter. make sure that there is an table names authentiction in your database.
                           2. then, if the login credentials are proper it will take you to the next page where you can type any queries and it will
                           be updated in the postgreSQL's database.
                           This is a very simple website that i created to showcase on how postgreSQL works.
